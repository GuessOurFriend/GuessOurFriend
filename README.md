# GuessOurFriend

To run our code, open Android Studio and check out this code. 
Then click run. This can be run either on an emulator or a connected
Android device. When the application opens, it will prompt for Facebook
credentails. For testing purposes, the email 
guessourfriend (at) gmail (dot) com and password of Blahblah37 can be used.


This will then take the user to the Challenge A Friend View where a list of
Facebook friends can be seen. The arrow in the upper left corner or the back
button can be used to navigate to other views. Most of these are currently
only "Hello World" views. The test view can be used to test that the mutual
friends (with Steve specifically) are loaded from Facebook, but nothing
is displayed on screen (only in the consoles log).
